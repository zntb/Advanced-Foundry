# The CCT Standard

## Introducing the Cross-Chain Token (CCT) Standard with CCIP v1.5

Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) version 1.5 marks a significant advancement for developers in the Web3 space by introducing the Cross-Chain Token (CCT) Standard. This standard provides a permissionless, standardized framework for making your existing or new tokens transferable across various blockchains supported by CCIP. This lesson will delve into the CCT Standard, explaining its implications for developers and how to leverage its capabilities.

## The Challenge: Liquidity Fragmentation and Developer Autonomy in a Multi-Chain World

As the blockchain ecosystem, particularly Decentralized Finance (DeFi), continues to mature, the ability to transfer assets and tokens seamlessly across different chains has become paramount. This drive for interoperability and shared liquidity addresses two critical pain points developers traditionally faced:

**1. Liquidity Fragmentation:**
Historically, assets often remained siloed on their native blockchains. This fragmentation made it challenging for users and liquidity providers to access and consolidate liquidity across diverse ecosystems. Token developers faced a difficult choice: deploy on a chain with established liquidity and user base, or opt for a newer, potentially faster-growing chain with its own set of trade-offs. The CCT Standard, in conjunction with CCIP, empowers developers to deploy their tokens on multiple chains and enable seamless liquidity sharing between them.

**2. Lack of Token Developer Autonomy:**
Previously, enabling cross-chain functionality for a token often necessitated third-party support or explicit permission from the interoperability protocol providers. Developers might have found themselves in a collaborative queue, waiting for protocol teams to integrate their specific token. The CCT Standard revolutionizes this by offering **permissionless integration**. Developers can independently integrate their tokens with CCIP, without requiring direct approval from Chainlink or other intermediaries. Furthermore, this standard ensures that developers maintain **complete custody and control** over their token contracts and the associated token pools on each chain.

## Benefits of the CCT Standard: Enhanced Security and Developer Control

Integrating your tokens using the CCT Standard means you are inherently leveraging the robust and battle-tested infrastructure of Chainlink CCIP. This brings several key benefits, particularly in terms of security and granular control:
**Security through Chainlink CCIP:**

- **Decentralized Oracle Network (DON):** All cross-chain messages, token transfers, and data are secured by Chainlink's proven DONs, ensuring reliable and tamper-resistant operations.

- **Defense-in-Depth Security:** CCIP is architected with multiple layers of security, providing a comprehensive approach to mitigating risks.

- **Risk Management Network:** An independent network continuously monitors CCIP activity for anomalies, adding an extra layer of proactive security.

**Configurable Rate Limits for Enhanced Token Security:**
While CCIP itself incorporates global rate limits, the CCT Standard empowers token developers with a crucial security feature: the ability to define their own **custom rate limits** for their specific token pools. These limits include:

- **Token Rate Limit Capacity:** The maximum amount of tokens that can be transferred out of a pool within a given timeframe.

- **Refill Timer/Rate:** The speed at which the token pool's transfer capacity replenishes.

These rate limits can be configured **per chain**, for both source and destination pools. This granular control allows developers to fine-tune token flow, significantly enhancing security against potential exploits attempting large, sudden drains from their token pools. If a transfer request exceeds the available capacity, it will be rejected, and the capacity will gradually refill according to the developer-defined rate.

## Unlocking Advanced Use Cases with Programmable Token Transfers

The CCT Standard facilitates **programmable token transfers**, a powerful feature that goes beyond simple asset bridging. It allows developers to specify custom actions to be executed automatically when tokens arrive on the destination chain.

This is achieved by enabling the simultaneous transmission of a **token transfer and an accompanying message (data or instructions)** within a single, atomic cross-chain transaction. This programmability opens the door to complex and innovative use cases, such as native cross-chain support for:

- **Rebase tokens:** Tokens whose supply adjusts algorithmically.

- **Fee-on-transfer tokens:** Tokens that apply a fee for each transaction.

Developers can now design sophisticated cross-chain interactions tailored to their token's unique mechanics.

## Understanding the CCT Standard Architecture

The CCT Standard introduces an architecture that moves away from traditional bridge-provider-managed, fragmented liquidity pools. Instead, the **token developer deploys and controls their own token pools** on each chain where their token will exist.

**Mechanism: Lock/Burn and Mint/Unlock**
These developer-controlled token pools operate using a Lock/Burn mechanism on the source chain and a corresponding Mint/Unlock mechanism on the destination chain:

- **Source Chain Pool:** For native tokens, this pool locks the tokens being transferred. For tokens that are "foreign" representations, this pool can burn them.

- **Destination Chain Pool:** Correspondingly, this pool unlocks tokens (if they were locked on another chain) or mints new tokens.
  This architecture allows existing ERC20 tokens to be extended to support CCT functionality. The core components involved are:

1. **Token Contract:**

   - This is your standard token contract (e.g., ERC20, ERC677).

   - It must be deployed on every chain where you want your token to be accessible via CCT.

   - It contains the core logic of your token, such as `transfer`, `balanceOf`, etc.

2. **Token Pool Contract:**

   - This contract is also deployed on every chain, and it's linked to the Token Contract on that specific chain.

   - It houses the cross-chain logic (Lock/Unlock or Burn/Mint mechanisms).

   - Crucially, your Token Pool Contract must inherit from Chainlink's base `TokenPool.sol` contract.

   - Chainlink provides standard, audited implementations like `BurnMintTokenPool.sol` (for tokens where you can mint/burn supply across chains) and `LockReleaseTokenPool.sol` (for tokens with a fixed supply that are locked/released) that developers can deploy directly.

   - This contract is responsible for executing the cross-chain transfers and managing the burn/lock/mint/unlock operations.

3. **Token Admin Registry:**

   - A central contract deployed by Chainlink on each CCIP-supported chain.

   - It serves as a registry mapping token addresses to their respective administrators (the addresses authorized to manage the token's pool configurations).

   - This registry enables developers to **self-register** their tokens and associate them with their deployed token pools.

4. **Registry Module Owner Custom:**

   - A contract that facilitates the assignment of token administrators within the Token Admin Registry.

   - It allows the deployer or designated owner of a token contract to authorize an address (typically their own or a multi-sig) as the admin for that specific token in the registry. This is a key component enabling the permissionless management aspect of the CCT Standard.

## Technical Deep Dive: Deploying a Cross-Chain Token with Foundry

This section provides a step-by-step guide on deploying a cross-chain token using the CCT Standard's Burn & Mint mechanism. We will simulate a deployment between the Sepolia and Arbitrum Sepolia testnets using the Foundry development toolkit.

This demonstration is based on the official Chainlink CCT tutorials, specifically the "Register from an EOA (Burn & Mint)" Foundry tutorial.

### Initial Setup and Configuration

1. **Starter Repository:** We'll use the `Cyfrin/ccip-cct-starter` repository, which is derived from `smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples`.

   - Clone the repository:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Cyfrin/ccip-cct-starter.git
     cd ccip-cct-starter
     ```

   - Open the project in your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code: `code .`).

2. **Configuration File (`config.json`):**

   - Locate the `config.json` file within the `script` directory. This file allows you to customize:

     - Token parameters: name, symbol, decimals, initial max supply.

     - CCIP fee type: Whether to pay CCIP fees in LINK or the native gas token of the source chain.

     - Remote chain linking: Mapping source chain IDs to destination chain IDs for cross-chain transfers.

   - For this demonstration, ensure `withGetCCIPAdmin` is set to `false`. This configuration uses the token owner method for registering the admin in the Token Admin Registry, leveraging the `RegistryModuleOwnerCustom` contract.

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   forge install
   ```

4. **Build Contracts:**

   ```bash
   forge build
   ```

5. **Environment Variables:**

   - Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.

   - Populate `.env` with your RPC URLs for the Sepolia and Arbitrum Sepolia testnets. Optionally, add Etherscan and Arbiscan API keys for contract verification.

     ```env
     SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=<your_sepolia_rpc_url>
     ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=<your_arbitrum_sepolia_rpc_url>
     PRIVATE_KEY=<your_deployer_private_key>
     # ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<your_etherscan_api_key> # Optional
     # ARBISCAN_API_KEY=<your_arbiscan_api_key>   # Optional
     ```

   - Load the environment variables into your current shell session:

     ```bash
     source .env
     ```

### Step-by-Step Deployment and Configuration

You will need your deployer address and keystore name (if using `forge` with a local keystore, otherwise ensure `PRIVATE_KEY` is set in `.env` for scripts to use). The following `forge script` commands will perform the deployment and configuration. Replace `<your-keystore-name>` and `<your-address>` where applicable if not using private key from `.env`.
**1. Deploy Token Contracts:**
Deploy your custom token contract (e.g., `MyCrossChainToken.sol` which inherits from `ERC20Burnable`, `ERC20Mintable`, `Ownable`) on both Sepolia and Arbitrum Sepolia. The `DeployToken.s.sol` script handles this, grants initial mint/burn roles to the deployer, and saves the deployed token addresses to output JSON files (e.g., `./script/output/deployedToken_ethereumSepolia.json`).

- On Sepolia:

  ```bash
  forge script script/DeployToken.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast --sender <your-address> -vvvv
  ```

- On Arbitrum Sepolia:

  ```bash
  forge script script/DeployToken.s.sol --rpc-url $ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast --sender <your-address> -vvvv
  ```

**2. Deploy Token Pools:**
Deploy the `BurnMintTokenPool` contract on both chains. This script associates the pool with the token deployed in step 1 and, importantly, grants mint/burn roles _to the token pool contract_ on the respective token contracts. This allows the pool to mint tokens on the destination chain and burn them on the source chain during a transfer.

- On Sepolia:

  ```bash
  forge script script/DeployBurnMintTokenPool.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast --sender <your-address> -vvvv
  ```

- On Arbitrum Sepolia:

  ```bash
  forge script script/DeployBurnMintTokenPool.s.sol --rpc-url $ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast --sender <your-address> -vvvv
  ```

**3. Claim CCIP Admin Role (via Owner):**
Since `withGetCCIPAdmin` was `false` in `config.json`, we use the owner method. This step involves calling the `registerAdminViaOwner` function on the `RegistryModuleOwnerCustom` contract. This function allows the owner of the token contract (the deployer in this case) to register an address (typically itself or a management contract) as the administrator for that token in the `TokenAdminRegistry`.

- On Sepolia:

  ```bash
  forge script script/ClaimAdmin.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast --sender <your-address> -vvvv
  ```

- On Arbitrum Sepolia:

  ```bash
  forge script script/ClaimAdmin.s.sol --rpc-url $ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast --sender <your-address> -vvvv
  ```

**4. Accept CCIP Admin Role:**
The address designated as admin in the previous step must now explicitly accept this role by calling the `acceptAdminRole` function on the `TokenAdminRegistry` contract for the specific token.

- On Sepolia:

  ```bash
  forge script script/AcceptAdminRole.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast --sender <your-address> -vvvv
  ```

- On Arbitrum Sepolia:

  ```bash
  forge script script/AcceptAdminRole.s.sol --rpc-url $ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast --sender <your-address> -vvvv
  ```

**5. Set Pools (Link Token to Pool):**
As the registered admin, you now associate your deployed token contract address with its corresponding deployed token pool address in the `TokenAdminRegistry`. This is done by calling the `setPool` function on the `TokenAdminRegistry`.

- On Sepolia:

  ```bash
  forge script script/SetPool.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast --sender <your-address> -vvvv
  ```

- On Arbitrum Sepolia:

  ```bash
  forge script script/SetPool.s.sol --rpc-url $ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast --sender <your-address> -vvvv
  ```

**6. Add Remote Chain to Pools:**
To enable cross-chain transfers _between_ your deployed pools, you must register each pool with its counterpart on the other chain. The `ApplyChainUpdates.s.sol` script achieves this by constructing a `TokenPool.ChainUpdate` struct. This struct contains information about the remote chain, including its CCIP chain selector, the remote token pool address, the remote token address, and the developer-defined rate limits for transfers _to_ that remote chain. This struct is then passed to the `applyChainUpdates` function on the _local_ token pool contract.

- On Sepolia (to link to Arbitrum Sepolia pool):

  ```bash
  forge script script/ApplyChainUpdates.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast --sender <your-address> -vvvv
  ```

- On Arbitrum Sepolia (to link to Sepolia pool):

  ```bash
  forge script script/ApplyChainUpdates.s.sol --rpc-url $ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast --sender <your-address> -vvvv
  ```

With these steps completed, your token and its associated pools are fully configured for cross-chain transfers between Sepolia and Arbitrum Sepolia.

### Executing and Verifying a Cross-Chain Transfer

Now, let's perform a test transfer.

**1. Mint Tokens (Optional but necessary for testing):**
If your deployer address doesn't yet have tokens on the source chain (Sepolia), mint some. The `MintTokens.s.sol` script calls the `mint` function on your deployed token contract.

- On Sepolia:

  ```bash
  forge script script/MintTokens.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast --sender <your-address> -vvvv
  ```

**2. Transfer Tokens Cross-Chain:**
Initiate a cross-chain transfer from Sepolia to Arbitrum Sepolia. The `TransferTokens.s.sol` script handles this. Internally, it: \* Constructs a `Client.EVM2AnyMessage` struct. This struct includes details like the receiver address on the destination chain, the amount of tokens to transfer, the fee token to use (LINK or native), and any extra data for programmable transfers. \* Approves the CCIP Router contract to spend the required amount of your tokens (and fee tokens, if using LINK). \* Calls the `ccipSend` function on the CCIP Router contract on the source chain (Sepolia).

- On Sepolia (sending to an address on Arbitrum Sepolia):

  ```bash
  forge script script/TransferTokens.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast --sender <your-address> -vvvv
  ```

  The script will output the source transaction hash.

**3. Verify the Transfer:** \* Copy the source transaction hash from your terminal. \* Navigate to the Chainlink CCIP Explorer: `https://ccip.chain.link/`. \* Paste the transaction hash into the search bar. \* The explorer will display the transaction details: Message ID, Source Transaction Hash, Status (e.g., "Waiting for finality," then "Processing," then "Success"), Source Chain, Destination Chain, From/To addresses, and the token transferred. \* Refresh the explorer page until the status shows "Success". This confirms that the tokens were burned on Sepolia and subsequently minted on Arbitrum Sepolia to the recipient address.
